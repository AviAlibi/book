Sunlight. For most it is synonymous with daytime, it is the time of work, and the time of enrichment. Not here though, not on Diman.

On Diman, sunlight and darkness are one and the same, they are both daytime, and night-time, all at once, they are work, and they are relaxation. There is no sunrise, nor set. There is only the farms. The vast, and immense farms that stretch across the horizons, held in perfect conditions to rapidly grow as much as possible in each solar rotation. The alignment engines built into the planet keeping one side perfectly facing the sun at all times are responsible for this. They have been in use since the Sentient Life Federation was formed out of fear of the impending galactic starvation.
