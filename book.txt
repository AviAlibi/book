CHAPTER 1: A history

Long ago, there was nothing, then there was everything. This is known as The First Creation.

In the First Creation, only one known species existed. These beings were known as The Composers. They traveled the universe to prepare for the next creatures. They split stars and formed worlds, all in the name of a liveable universe. For trillions and trillions of years, these Composers had worked. They believed themselves to be immortals, dedicated to the creation of life and its everlasting gifts.

Then the Composers were gone.

Some say the Composers were agents of a God, sent to finish his masterpiece, others say that they were hyper advanced super beings that uncovered the secret to immortality, and chose to die.

Their work is known as The Second Creation.

CHAPTER 2: Ravams Sons

A farmer named Ravam, an old wise man, who produced more food for the people then anyone else. Every day was the same, wake up, tend to the crops, and then head to the house. He would store the crops in a silo, just next to the fields. Once every so often, upon the filling of the silo, he would call for the townsmen to bring their carts and load them with his crops. They would carry them into town on his behalf, where they would be sold.

One day, upon the filling of the silo, 12 men approached him as he walked to his home. They said they were Composers with the Mayors band. 

"12 Composers? Why so many?" asked Ravam.

Total silence. None of them spoke, or even met his gaze.

He felt a bit uneasy. Why were these men here? Did they need something from him?

In silence, the men began looking around the area. They seemed interested in the fields, and in the silo.

"This land is not for sale" began Ravam, "I have cared for this land and its crops since I was just a boy. I cannot part with it"
